4. On the left hand tab, under "Project", right click on "final_code", and near the bottom hover over "Mark Directory as" and select "Sources Root" (it should have a Blue Folder icon beside it).
5. Go to: final_code/deep_learning_dentistry/package_downloader.py 
6. Here, you will see a list of packages that are used in this project. To ensure all are downloaded, hover over any package with a squiggle/tilde under it's name (package names follow "import" command). Then, select "install package __name__".

- ChartGeneralNew_Final.xlsx
- ChartRestorative_final.xlsx
- DemographicData.xlsx
- Mobility_Furcation_Index_MAG.xlsx
- Pockets.xlsx
- Recessions.xlsx
- Suppuration.xlsx
8. Then, go to: "final_code/deep_learning_dentistry/data_curation/data_curator.py". Run this file by clicking the Pause Icon in the top right. This will process and curate all the data from the Raw file.
9. To extract the final dataset, go to: "final_code/deep_learning_dentistry/data_curation/raw_data_curator_long.py" and run. This will produce the final dataset located in "final_code/data" under the name "curated_dataset.csv".

General Navigation Of The Dataset
=
- deep_learning_dentistry is where all the code lies.
- deep_learning_dentistry/data_curation is where all processing and curation of the raw data into one final dataset lies.
- deep_learning_dentistry/deep_learning_analysis/variable_analysis is where variable specific analysis is done
